Monte carlo script ties together strategy creator and backtest scripts. 
p1-p5 are parameters which will have randomized weighting. This randomized weighting goes into strategy creator script 
and creates unique signals which will then go into backtest script. Results will go back to monte carlo script and 
be documented. ex: p1 =0.3, p2=0.5, p3=0.5, p4=0.5, p5=0.5 -> alpha = 0.17 (alpha is return for unique strategy)

Once results are generated user can analyze returns and their respective parameters.

F(x) = R(p1,p2,p3,p4,p5) 
where p1-p5 are weights which affect the unique strategy outputed.
